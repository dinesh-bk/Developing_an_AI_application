# Developing an AI Application

The incorporation of AI algorithms into everyday applications had been foreseen as an ongoing trend. For instance, an image classifier was considered for inclusion in a smartphone app. This involved utilizing a deep learning model, which had been trained on a vast array of images, as an integral part of the overall application architecture. The utilization of such models had been anticipated as a significant aspect of software development in the future.

In that project, an image classifier had been trained to recognize various species of flowers. The potential application was envisioned in a phone app that could identify flowers captured by the camera. The process entailed training the classifier and subsequently exporting it for integration into the application. A dataset containing 102 flower categories had been used for this purpose, displaying several examples.

The project had been structured into multiple steps:
- Loading and preprocessing the image dataset
- Training the image classifier on the dataset
- Employing the trained classifier to predict image content

Each of these steps had been guided, with implementation performed using Python.

Upon completion of this project, an application capable of being trained on any labeled image set had been developed. The network, in this case, had been trained specifically on flowers and had evolved into a command line application. However, the utilization of newly acquired skills was open-ended, contingent upon individual creativity and effort in constructing a dataset. For instance, envisioning an app that identifies car make and model from a picture and retrieves related information. This highlighted the potential for creating unique applications through the creation of custom datasets.

The initial step involved importing the necessary packages, adhering to the practice of consolidating all imports at the code's outset. As the notebook progressed and additional package imports were required, they were consistently added at this juncture.
